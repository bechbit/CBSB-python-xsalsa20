The script will encrypt the contents of the source file to the destination file using the xsalsa20 cipher and poly1305 verification. The password will be used to encrypt the file, so it is important to choose a strong password/phrase. The script will also verify the integrity of the encrypted file using the poly1305 verification algorithm. This ensures that the file has not been tampered with during the encryption process.
